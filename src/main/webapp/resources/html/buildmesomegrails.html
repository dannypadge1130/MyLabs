	<p>Because my overwhelming need to be organized and lazy I decided
		to setup a centralized build setup for this site and other grails
		sites I maintain.</p>

	<p>First I did some research on 3rd party hosted CI tools. I mean,
		why re-invent the wheel? Their are a quite a few out there, and more popping up each
		day. But, grails isn't supported by many 3rd party tools. So, I wasn't able to find
		a 3rd party CI that supported grails and fulfilled my personal
		checklist. So that meant I have to host it myself. Ugh...</p>

	<p>I looked into 2 of what I consider to be the most popular build
		tools out, QuickBuild and Jenkins. After reviewing both, I decided to
		go with QuickBuild (Jenkins cult, please don't cut me). Although both
		are viable options what pulled me toward QuickBuild was that its GUI
		was a little more User Friendly, I liked its inheritance model, and
		that it provided the option of write groovy scripts.</p>

	<p>Hosting and setting up QuickBuild was a breeze. I built it out
		on an old laptop running Ubuntu. I setup SSH, and just port forwarded
		QuickBuilds default port 8810 to run my builds. I ran build/deploys
		out this way for several months and truly enjoyed it. It was really
		nice while it lasted, but like all good things they must be destroyed
		by a dummy messing with environment variables. Yes.. Yes.. I drank
		some dumb person juice and started messing around with ROOT
		environment variables and destroyed my Ubuntu installation.... lol.</p>

	<p>Because of pure laziness of not wanted to setup QuickBuild
		again. I told myself "Hey Dan, just write you're own scripts..", So I
		did.</p>

	<p>I wrote two separate scripts a build script and a deploy script.
		Both of these are extremely basic, and I provided overviews of both
		below.</p>
